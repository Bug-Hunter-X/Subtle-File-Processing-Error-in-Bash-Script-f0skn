# Subtle Bash Scripting Error: File Processing and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in bash scripting related to file processing and error handling.  The script attempts to process a file that may not exist and lacks robust error checking before proceeding. This can lead to unexpected behavior or missed errors.

The `bug.sh` file contains the buggy script, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The solution emphasizes more robust checks and clearer error reporting.

**Key Issues Addressed:**

*   **Non-existent file:** The original script fails to check if the target file exists before attempting to process it.
*   **Inadequate error handling:** Error checking is minimal, leading to potential issues going unnoticed.

This example highlights the importance of thorough error checking and robust file handling practices in bash scripting.
